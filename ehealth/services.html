        <h3>Primary Care</h3>
        <p>Primary care is your healthcare home. Primary care providers are trained to prevent, diagnose, and treat conditions you may have across your whole life span. Primary care includes preventive services like diabetes and cancer screenings, diagnosis and treatment of acute injuries and sickness, and management of long-term conditions. Primary care providers can include family physicians, internists, geriatricians, pediatricians, OB-GYNs, nurse practitioners, or physician assistants. Primary care allows you to get comprehensive care from a provider that knows and understands you — and possibly knows your family and community as well.
        Your primary care provider can perform many different diagnostic services, treatments, and procedures. Here are just a few of the services they commonly provide:
                cancer screenings,
                cardiovascular health screenings,
                diabetes screenings,
                medication prescriptions,
                immunizations,
                minor surgical procedures like suturing wounds,
                birth control services,
                ultrasounds,
                casting, splinting, and bracing,
                wound care,
                health counseling.</p>

        <h3>Specialty Services</h3>
        <p>"Specialty services" in the context of healthcare typically refer to specific medical services or areas of expertise that go beyond general primary care. These services are often provided by specialists—medical professionals who have advanced training and education in a particular field of medicine. Here's a brief overview of what specialty services in healthcare might encompass:
        Cardiology: Specializing in the diagnosis and treatment of heart and cardiovascular system disorders.
        Dermatology:Focused on the diagnosis and treatment of skin conditions, diseases, and cosmetic concerns.
        Orthopedics:Specializing in the musculoskeletal system, including bones, joints, ligaments, tendons, and muscles.
        Gastroenterology:Focused on the digestive system, including the stomach, intestines, liver, and pancreas.
        Psychiatry:Specializing in mental health, including the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders.
        Allergy and Immunology:Focused on allergies, asthma, and disorders related to the immune system.
        Infectious Disease: Specializing in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites.</p>

        <h3>Telemedicine</h3>
        <p>Telemedicine, which enables video or phone appointments between a patient and their health care practitioner, benefits both health and convenience. More health care providers are offering to “see” patients by computer and smartphone. “Health organizations are providing virtual appointments and are expanding their telehealth options, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic,” says Brian Hasselfeld, M.D. Hasselfeld is assistant medical director for digital health innovations at Johns Hopkins Medicine. Improved technology has made telemedicine easier, even for those who don’t consider themselves computer savvy. Patients can use telemedicine through the MyChart online platform or mobile app, and request a virtual visit with many Johns Hopkins doctors, practitioners and therapists. Telemedicine can give some specialty practitioners an advantage because they can see you in your home environment. For example, allergists may be able to identify clues in your surroundings that cause allergies. Neurologists and physical and occupational therapists can observe you and assess your ability to navigate and take care of yourself in your home. Telemedicine is also a good way to get mental health assessment and counseling. </p>
